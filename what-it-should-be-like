what the game should be like:
fast and furious 2 type brian o'connor ride around/road trips different to different cities for different races and different cars
give gamers a short history/explanation and understanding of customization and character of the cars. this should have gamers be more engaged with customiaation. they should be confident in thinking about cars and coming up with ways to modify them.
driving should be laid back. night time lighting should be like assetto corsa rally
