----------------------Lecture 1-----------------------------
what is a program?
	A set of instructions to the computer written ina programming language. 
	Has input and output.

what is a programming language?
	Formal way to communicate instructions to the computer.

why are they created this way?
	to be understandable to humans but be precise for computers.

what purpose should a programming language serve?
	be expressive in at least one domain. stability, performance, evolution.

categorization of programming languages:
	imperative:   oop ("how-to" instructions)
	declarative:  functional ("what" instructions)
	hybrid:       both

characteristics of programming languages:
	typing: (strong vs weak); (static vs dynamic)

	from code to execution:
		1. to machine code
		2. to byte code
		3. transpile to other
		4. interpret

	memory management:
		fully manual
		garbage collection
		ownership based
		scope based
typing:
	STATIC: type checked at compile time, DYNAMIC: type redefined many times
	STRONG: defined once and can't converte, WEAK: type can be converted 

how to choose a programming language for a problem?
	find what language is usually used for the problem. 
	compare time-to-market/performance
	check the community activity

-------------------------Lecture 2----------------------------
why focus on the concepts of programming languages?
	recogniza and apply common patterns
	develop transferable skills for learning new languages
	make more informed language selection decisions
	enhance clearity and precision

domains of application:
	scientific and engineering computing
	busieness and enterprise systems
	AI or ML
	web and distributed systems
	embeded systems
	oss libraries 

language design methodologies and trade-offs:
	influences:
		computer architecture
		growing software complexity
		changing economics

	paradigms:
		set of abstractions to express ideas
		make details transparent and reason on higher level

	trade-offs:
		reliability vs cost 
		writability vs readability
		performance vs adaptability vs reusability

language design by implementation:
	compilation
	interpretation
	hybrid / bytecode jit
	preprocessor
